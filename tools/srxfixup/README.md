# srxfixup

This tool mainly handles generation of IRX and ERX files, mainly used as \
relocatable executables or libraries.  
This tool performs the following tasks on relocatable ELF files in order to \
ensure that loadcore can load it as a relocatable file:

* Sets the ELF header `e_type` to `0xFF80`, `0xFF81`, or `0xFF91`, depending \
on the features and architecture used
* Creates the `.iopmod` or `.eemod` section and first program header, \
containing metadata about the file, such as name, version, and section sizes/offsets
* Rebuilds relocations

## Aliases

This tool provides the following:

* `iopfixup`
* `irx-strip`
* `eefixup`
* `erx-strip`

## Usage
